# Spatio-Temporal-Steering-Prediction
Implementation of BMW's Conv-LSTM network based off of NVIDIA's PilotNet

History:
Was originally using a dataset from  https://github.com/SullyChen/Autopilot-TensorFlow
Need to get the real Udactiy Self Driving Car dataset
Able to overfit the network with a small dataset (1000 images)
Tensorboard shows that network is actually training, however output is total garbage.
data.txt is the format to get the file names and read the data in from a different folder.
